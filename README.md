# Temporal.js

Yet another JavaScript library for handling dates. I am well aware of the existence of Moment.js. I did this solely as a learning project and I learned a lot. All things aside though, it's a pretty usable library. It's less than a quarter of the size of Moment.js and it can do pretty much all the things we usually use Moment.js for.

## Documentation

You can find instructions on how to use this library [on my website here](https://www.davidtimovski.com/MyProjects/Temporal).
